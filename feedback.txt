Hello Naama this is your Hackaton feedback.
In general i liked the idea of your game and the way you make the user go throw the game very smooth.
I was excited while i was playing and was fun to have the timer running. 

About the content learned in clase i saw a good implementation of DOM manipulation, a good use of time intervals
to start actions and then stop when the intervals end. An also good use of event handlers.

I woulded liked to see maybe more questions so you could have implement a function where you can set a 
defined way for questions and answers to work and you will not need to create on fucntion for each question.
First creating an array of object(question), and then with a foreach develop each of the questions games like 
deploy the image, or check if the answer was correct. when working with classes this type of task will be easier.

Good job congratulations on your Hackaton.
